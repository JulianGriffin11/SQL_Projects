# **SQL Database Management of Job Jury** 📊

Welcome to the **Job Jury** database management project! 🚀   

These SQL files set up and manage **Luke Barousse's** job posting database, enabling efficient storage, querying, and analysis of job-related data, company details, and required skills. Below is a quick **breakdown** of what each file does:

---

## **1. Database Creation** 📂
- Creates the **sql_course** database to house the entire project data.
- Ensures the database is set up and ready for table creation and data import. 🔧

---

## **2. Table Creation** 🏗️
- Defines essential tables: **company_dim**, **skills_dim**, and **job_postings_fact**.
- Establishes primary keys for data integrity and foreign keys to establish relationships between the tables. 🔑

---

## **3. Data Import & Optimization** 📥⚡
- Imports data from CSV files into the corresponding tables using the `COPY` command.
- Optimizes database performance by creating indexes on key columns to speed up queries. ⚡
